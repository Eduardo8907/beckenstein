# Beckenstein
Class Project - Website for the fabric store Beckenstein
 
In this project I had to redesign this website with the following client assesment:

*******

Name: ​Beckenstein Fabrics

Presenting Problem: ​heading of the website seems a bit unorganized and can be cleaned up.
The Grey background gives it a unattracted feel. There are visibly uneven margins. Color and
detail need cleaning up so that the user can gather the information they need as quick and easy
as possible.

Solution: ​provide a brighter and cleaner canvas. To make sure they have easy access to all the
info in the website. To make certain aspects more user friendly . find a way to shorten long
information so the user won’t scroll so much

I used BootStrap and JQuery in this project.
